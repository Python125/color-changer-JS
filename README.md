For this JavaScript project, I have built a very simple color changer. This color changer was built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project introduced me to event listeners and a HTML DOM method. This project includes four buttons that change the color of the large square in the upper center of the screen.

Before I began to work on this project, I planned out the course of action. I listed all the HTML and JavaScript elements on a notepad, set up a Trello board, and listed all the tasks that I needed to complete for this project in separate cards. Once I finished planning, I jumped right over to build the project.

For the HTML, I added a div tag with an id that says "colorbox", with an h1 tag inside the div that says "Color Changer". The next thing I did was add four buttons, with each of them having classes representing the colors that the buttons will change the square to, and an HTML attribute (onclick) that makes the button perform an action when clicked. Looking at my progress on the HTML, I added a break tag between the large square and the buttons because I wanted to be able to create some space.

When I started working on the JavaScript, I looked back at my Trello board and my notepad and started to implement event listeners. Some of the challenges that I faced while coding the JavaScript included implementing the event listeners, buttons, and functions that manipulated the color of the square. However, I was able to make it work. Below are some screenshots of the project for your convenience.
