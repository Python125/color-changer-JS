For this JavaScript project, I have built a very simple color changer. This color changer was built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project introduced me to event listeners and a HTML DOM method. This project includes four buttons that change the color of the large square in the upper center of the screen. When the user clicks on one of the buttons (e.g. red), it changes to that color. Some of the challenges that I faced included implementing the event listeners, buttons, and functions that manipulate the color of the square. However, I was able to make it work. Below are some screenshots of the project for your convenience.
